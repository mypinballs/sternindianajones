# Indiana Jones Pinball V2 by myPinballs - Extended Project

##Aim
To create new pinball software for Stern Indiana Jones using the game code rewrite, that i have built up for the first Indiana Jones Pinball by Williams in 1993, as a basis and then altering as required.

##Author
[mypinballs](http://www.mypinballs.co.uk) is Jim Askey, a Java J2EE software programmer and long term pinball addict/restorer. The opportunity to write new software using the excellent p-roc hardware and pyprocgame development framework for his favourite all time titles proved too much not to have a go :)
